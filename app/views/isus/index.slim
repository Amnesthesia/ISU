        | Every 6 months the ISU re-elects board-members, and the time has come for
        | a new re-election. Due to lack of interest in a physical re-election as was
        | first attempted, the local ISU branch at the ISU Gj√∏vik University College
        | has decided to instead accept applications for all free positions.
        | To apply for the ISU, just click your preferred social media icon, and
        | check what positions you'd be interested in, and just write a personal
        | letter.
        | The process is easy, click the icon to get started!
